# Overview

This repository is designed to store assets such as images, diagrams, and other resources used in various projects. By storing assets here, you can link to them from other repositories without including the assets in those repositories. This approach keeps individual repositories smaller and faster to clone. Links to these assets are typically included in README files, documentation, or other resources, providing seamless access to the assets.

## Structure

Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific repository or project. This structure allows for organized asset management, easy linking to content from other repositories, and a centralized location for all project assets.
